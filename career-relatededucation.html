			  	 <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">FBLA CHAPTER INVOLVEMENT</h2>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">I have been a dedicated member of this club for five years. It all began when I competed in the Pseudo-Bay Section conferences in my 7th and 8th grades, as part of the Cupertino FBLA Middle Level Project. These formative experiences have lead me to pursue both FBLA Competitive Events and committee/project positions in my high school career.</p>
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">Competitive Record (2014 - Present)</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">In 2016, I won 2nd place at the Bay Section Leadership Conference (BSLC) in “Agribusiness,” and I went on to become the State Champion at the California State Leadership Conference (SLC), and attended the National Leadership Conference (NLC) in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2017, I won 4th place at BSLC in “Parliamentary Procedure,” 2nd place at SLC in “Introduction to Parliamentary Procedure,” and won 8th place in “Introduction to Parliamentary Procedure” at the NLC, in Anaheim, California.</p>
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">Middle Level Committee Member (2015-2017)</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">In this position, I prepared and delivered bi-weekly lectures and educational activities about various business fields to students at Hyde Middle School, and assisted them in preparing for the annual Pseudo-Bay Sections, a mock FBLA conference giving younger students the opportunity to attempt competitive events even before entering high school. I feel that this was a rewarding experience for me because it helped me to contextualize why exactly I feel FBLA is important to me: because it encourages excellence among newer generations in business. And I have applied this value, that of perspective, in everything I do, as part of my desire to avoid complacency.</p>
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">American Enterprise Committee Member (2017 - Present)</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">As part of this committee, I focused on producing promotional content, such as posters, flyers, and videos, spreading information about e-business and entrepreneurship to a variety of individuals in my community. Again, I feel that that I have gained the most from this committee in terms of perspective. By educating others, particularly young children and the elderly, about the system of American Enterprise, this experience has helped me comprehend the vast advantages I possess compared to the rest of the world. Knowing how well off I am motivates me to live up to my potential, to try and take charge of the myriad opportunities I have been given.</p>
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">Voting Delegate (2016 - Present)</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">My chapter, Cupertino High School, has often asked me to be their representative in caucuses at the regional, state, and national levels. I have been an official voting delegate at the 2016 NLC, the 2017 California SLC, and the 2018 BSLC. Over the years, I have watched plenty of unlikely candidates rise and all too many self-assured candidates fall. Overall, these experiences have allowed me to witness, in person, what moves people and what does not, in terms of persuasive and rhetorical techniques. I have applied what I have learned to my own public speaking ventures.</p>

			  	 <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">RELEVANT COURSEWORK</h2>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">Throughout my high school journey, much of my coursework has taught me skills which strongly correlate with the abilities I will need in order to be successful in my career as a Software Architect.</p>
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">AP Computer Science A</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">This course given me the opportunity me to learn how to write computer programs and applications in Java. In addition, it introduced me to the basic principles of algorithmic problem solving, UI design, and object oriented programming. Gaining a solid foundation in these essential skills has enabled me to pursue computer science further, outside of the classroom.</p>
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">AP Calculus BC</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">I learned the fundamentals of integral, differential, and limit calculus in this course. In addition, I gained problem-solving skills by applying these new concepts to complex, real-world problems. Overall, I gained a variety of skill sets which will be absolutely critical in my career as a Software Architect.</p>
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">AP Chemistry</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">Over the course of the year, I have completed in-class practical investigations and produced in-depth lab reports to document and analyze my findings. In this course, my ability to work in a collaborative group environment has improved by leaps and bounds, as I harmoniously worked with a group of three classmates as part of a lab group.</p>
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">American Literature Honors</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">This class has reinforced my skills in writing and public speaking. In addition, it has bolstered my ability to approach any and all subjects from a critical, analytical perspective. Both these abilities are prerequisites for success in the modern workplace.</p>
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">AP United States History</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">By allowing me to explore and gain a deeper appreciation for the history of the US though historical documents, statistics, political cartoons, and other primary sources, this course has significantly bolstered my general knowledge. Consequently, it has shaped me into a more thoughtful speaker and communicator, which will benefit me in any career.</p>
