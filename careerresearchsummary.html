A software architect is involved in all aspects of a project’s lifecycle, from ideation through requirements analysis, design and implementation. This is a hands-on position, requiring skillful research, analytical thinking, design intuition, and smooth delivery of solutions that meet corporate needs at a massive scale. The Software Architect’s influence reaches across the organization, providing critical leadership and guidance in the adoption of technical solutions, strategies, and design motifs across multiple teams.</p>
