		    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">The reason why I chose the field of Software Architecture is because I already have extensive knowledge in big data analytics, from my ongoing internship with the University of Arizona. I have also pursued coding through coursework and relevant activities. I am also interested in the business side of the tech industry, which motivated my successful years of involvement with FBLA. By combining my knowledge in business with my solid technical background, I know I can be a successful software architect as described in my research below.</p>

				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">Software Architects oversee and work closely with other members of a development team such as programmers, designers, UX engineers, quality assurance, and sales teams. They are usually the head of software development and oftentimes report directly to upper management. A software architect is involved in all aspects of a project’s lifecycle, from ideation through requirements analysis, design and implementation. This is a hands-on position, requiring skillful research, analytical thinking, design intuition, and smooth delivery of solutions that meet corporate needs at a massive scale. The Software Architect’s influence reaches across the organization, providing critical leadership and guidance in the adoption of technical solutions, strategies, and design motifs across multiple teams.</p>
