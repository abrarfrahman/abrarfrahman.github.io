			  	 <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">PUBLIC SPEAKING</h2>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">Throughout my high school career, I have been a dominant competitor in speech and debate. I compete in the Varsity division for both Congressional Debate and Extemporaneous Speech. As a consequence of these experiences, I have learned how to confidently speak in front of large audiences. These experiences have shaped me into an assertive public speaker and make me far more qualified to be a Software Architect, as they require strong public speaking skills to communicate and present information to their fellow co-workers, in order to effectively collaborate on large projects. </p>
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">Description of Events</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">In Congressional Debate, I deliver three minute long pre-prepared speeches on policy-oriented topics in mock legislative sessions. As part of this, I have drafted “bills” (proposed laws) and “resolutions” (position statements), which have been selected by major tournaments such as the 2017 California High School Speech Association (CHSSA) State Qualifiers as topics for student debate. Meanwhile, in Extemporaneous Speech, I have delivered seven minute long memorized speeches, given only thirty minutes of preparation, on topics focusing on global and domestic affairs.</p>
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">Congressional Debate Competitive Record (2017)</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">◦&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.joyoftournaments.com/ca/jameslogan/2017/">James Logan Invitational,</a> Semifinalist;</p>

			  	 <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">EVENT PLANNING</h2>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">Anyone wishing to advance from a entry-level position as a Software Architect ought have the ability to organize promotional events and/or internal social events for their company in their back pocket at all times, to differentiate oneself from the flock. As a member of both the Middle Level and American Enterprise project committees in my local chapter, I have gained the ability to organize large events and coordinate with others to make said events successful. This ability, to organize and promote real-life events, will be absolutely critical to my mobility in the field of Software Architecture.</p>
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">Pseudo-Bay Sections (2016-2017)</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">I helped run the Pseudo-Bay Sections, an annual mock FBLA conference which gives middle-schoolers the opportunity to attempt competitive events that they would not otherwise be able to experience before high school. Annually, roughly 200 students are in attendance. I was responsible for assigning competitive events for students from the 87-member strong chapter at Hyde Middle School, which sent a delegation of more than twenty students to the conference. I was responsible for preparing them for the oral, presentation-centric events.</p> 
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">Holiday Marketplace (2017)</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">Through my position on the American Enterprise committee, I helped operate our annual Holiday Marketplace Faire. Over a period of five weeks, the committee delivered presentations to students at Sedgwick Elementary School on topics such as personal finance, e-business, and entrepreneurship. Then, on the official event day, we gave approximately 80 elementary schoolers the opportunity to operate booths and sell products that they designed, produced, and marketed themselves.</p> 
				 
				 <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">Promotional Work</h3>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">I have attached a few examples of the promotional content I generated for the American Enterprise Committee, demonstrating my mastery of design software and public relations. I even starred in a comically-bad promotional video for our American Enterprise Week, which garnered more than 1400 views on Facebook. I have attached a link to the video, as well as examples of some of my graphic design work, below.</p>

			  	 <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">MUSIC</h2>
				 <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">Since elementary school, I have been passionate about music and playing musical instruments. To that end, I have been a part of the CHS Proud Pioneer Marching Band since my freshman year, playing the Alto Saxophone, an instrument which I have now been playing for the last six years. In addition, since my sophomore year, I have played with the highest ranking music class available, the audition-only Wind Ensemble. Additionally, I have publicly performed on the Soprano Saxophone, Tenor Saxophone, Baritone Saxophone, and the acoustic guitar. In the 7th and 8th grades, I lead a Saxophone Trio, which earned medals of commendation at the CMEA Solo-Ensemble Festival. Currently, I am leading a group of my fellow musicians to perform Saxophone Choir music in public, and we have our first performance scheduled for March 6, 2018. I have been willing to invest a great deal of my time into pursuing music, because I feel that it is important for everyone, regardless of their career choices, to have interests outside of work. Music has always been one of mine.</p>
